# Tungstenite

Lightweight stream-based WebSocket implementation for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

```rust
use std::net::TcpListener;
use std::thread::spawn;
use tungstenite::server::accept;

/// A WebSocket echo server
fn main () {
    let server = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:9001").unwrap();
    for stream in server.incoming() {
        spawn (move || {
            let mut websocket = accept(stream.unwrap()).unwrap();
            loop {
                let msg = websocket.read_message().unwrap();

                // We do not want to send back ping/pong messages.
                if msg.is_binary() || msg.is_text() {
                    websocket.write_message(msg).unwrap();
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

Introduction
------------
This library provides an implementation of WebSockets,
[RFC6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455). It allows for both synchronous (like TcpStream)
and asynchronous usage and is easy to integrate into any third-party event loops including
[MIO](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio). The API design abstracts away all the internals of the
WebSocket protocol but still makes them accessible for those who wants full control over the
network.

Why Tungstenite?
----------------

It's formerly WS2, the 2nd implementation of WS. WS2 is the chemical formula of
tungsten disulfide, the tungstenite mineral.

Features
--------

Tungstenite provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket specification.
TLS is supported on all platforms using native-tls or rustls available through the `native-tls`
and `rustls-tls` feature flags.

There is no support for permessage-deflate at the moment. It's planned.

Testing
-------

Tungstenite is thoroughly tested and passes the [Autobahn Test Suite](https://crossbar.io/autobahn/) for
WebSockets. It is also covered by internal unit tests as well as possible.
